<span id="para1"> Hello!  My name is Adam Glover.  I am an older adult returning to college to complete a BA in Computer Science.
    You may be thinking, "Hey I don't really know anything about you."  Well, let's fix that.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I have about 20 years of residential and commercial low voltage experience under my belt.
I am well versed in Wireless Networks, holding certifications in both Ubiquiti and Araknis products.  Closed Circuit Television, where I have worked with all types of camera systems for many companies you've heard of like Doctor's Care and Best Buy.
Intrusion Systems, where there are far to many types to list, and quite possibly my favorite area of expertise, Automation and Audio/Video.  From home theatres to smart houses, 
I've worked with many products and systems (Like those really cool multi-screen video walls). 
<br>
<br>
Now that's enough about work stuff, I enjoy the more personal stuff more.   I am quite passionate about 
music production and composing music, I make all kinds!   Cinematic music, house/edm music, blues music, rock music, pop music, video game music...just...music.  I also have interests in game design, dabble a bit in 3d modeling, and really enjoy coding.  If only I could mix them all together...Video Games anyone?
<br>
<br>
Well, I hope you've gotten to know me a bit better, and if you'd be interested in working together on any projects,
please reach out.  My information is available in the Contact page. For those interested, here is an easy
